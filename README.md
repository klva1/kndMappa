# kndMappa
my node.js repo for such experimental code adventures such as:

***deferred.js,   promise.js,   scribbles.js,   kache.js,   signals.js,   clusterServer.js*** as well as a few others.... theyre all in my javascript experimental Repo!!!

***deferred.js & promise.js*** work together as a fast and light weight, 99% W3 comliant implimentation of the promise A-spec.

***scribbles.js*** is a non-blocking threadsafe, async file writer/appender for node.js

***kache.js*** is a automatc and configurable resource & static file cache module. It utilizes headers, as well as buffered storage living under a super fast custom async queueing layer.

**signals.js** is my isomorphic event management / transmission system for server or browser. Its faster than any of the other emitters. Its 100% vanilla.js its super small, configurable, and supports once, receivers, dropReceivers, receive, & signal. Its relatively similar in its api usage to node's event emitter. It also works under all inheritance patterns.

***clusterServer*** is my custom webserver implimenting clustered processes forked by cpu core count as well as utilization workload heuristics.

theres some others as well, but these are closest to prime time ready. check it out yo!
